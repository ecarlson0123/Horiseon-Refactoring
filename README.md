# Challenge 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Summary of Project

## Goal 1: Semantic HTML Elements and Accessability
The primary goal of this challenge was to provide the customer(Horiseon) with an HTML file that used semantic elements and ensured the deployed site was more accessable to accessability features like screen readers.
    -Within this section I made the decision that the images on the website were purely decorative and contained no useful information, and becasue of this the alternative text was set to be blank. Especially due to the fact that we were provided with no information on the content contained in the images. (For example; an alternate text such as "Colorful social media terms in comment bubbles" is more harmful than useful to someone needing to be read the page.)

## Goal 2: Organize and Restructure CSS File
Secondly, the original style sheet was incredibly repetitive and needed to be restructured in order to create a logical workflow, that makes for easier editing and location of certain style elements based on the order of the main HTML file.
    -Single class styles were made to compensate for the repetitive nature and applied to multiple elements using their class.

## Added Change: Element Sizes
Another ajustment that was made was; in the original mockup, the content section height didn't match that of the benefits section. I believe this made for a messy look and having both sections end a the same point makes the website look neater and more planned. This can be seen in the following photos.
    -Another benefit this provides is that the footer looks likes it is meant to be centered beacuse the right side is no longer "busy" due to the bottom of the benefits section intruding.
